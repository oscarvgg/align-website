## What Is Time Blocking?

Time blocking is a productivity method where you divide your day into dedicated chunks for specific tasks. Unlike a simple to-do list, you assign specific timeframes to each activity, which helps you:

- Prioritize important work during peak productivity hours
- Minimize distractions and context-switching
- Visualize how you're spending your time
- Create consistent routines and build better habits

## How to Use Time Blocking Templates

1. **Choose your template** (daily, weekly, or monthly)
2. **List your priorities** and identify important tasks
3. **Schedule high-focus work** during your most productive hours
4. **Add effort-intensive activities** like exercise or deep work
5. **Include breaks and buffer time** between tasks
6. **Color-code activities** to create a visual schedule that's easy to follow

## Types of Time Blocking Templates

### Daily Templates (Including 24-Hour Planning)
