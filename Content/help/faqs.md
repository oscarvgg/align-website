# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### On what platforms is Align available?
Align is coming soon to all Apple platforms - iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and macOS. This means you'll be able to manage your time blocks seamlessly across all your Apple devices.

Align will launch first on iOS and then roll out to other Apple platforms (iPadOS, watchOS, and macOS) based on user demand. This staged approach allows us to focus on delivering the best possible experience on each platform while responding to our users' needs.

### Is Align free?
Align will be available as a free download with core features. Still, we plan to offer a Pro subscription that unlocks additional powerful features for users who want to improve their time management.

### Why should I use time blocking?
Time blocking is one of the most effective time management strategies successful people like Elon Musk and Cal Newport use. By assigning specific time slots to tasks, you gain better control over your day, reduce context switching, and make your goals more achievable by turning them into concrete actions.

## Calendar & Sync

### Why does Align need full calendar access?
Full calendar access is essential as your calendar serves as the source of truth for all your time blocks. This access is required for Align's core functionality, allowing you to:
- View all your existing calendar events as time blocks.
- Prevent double-booking by seeing potential conflicts.
- Create and manage time blocks directly in your calendar.
- Keep everything synchronized and up-to-date.

Align cannot function as intended without full calendar access since it relies on your calendar to store and manage your time blocks. Your calendar data remains private and is only used to enhance your planning experience.

### Can I sync Align across multiple devices?
Yes! Align uses iCloud to automatically sync your time blocks, settings, and preferences across all your Apple devices.

### Can I import my existing calendars?
Absolutely! Align can import and display events from any calendar on your local iOS/macOS calendars.

## Features & Usage

### How do recurring time blocks work?
Align makes it easy to create repeating schedules that fit your routine. You can set time blocks to repeat:
- Daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly
- On specific days of the week (like every Monday and Wednesday)
- On certain days of the month (like the first Monday)
- For a set number of times or until a specific end date

This flexibility is perfect for:
- Building consistent habits (like morning workouts)
- Planning regular meetings
- Setting up routine tasks (like weekly reviews)
- Maintaining a structured schedule

### Can I customize the appearance of time blocks?
Yes! Each time block can be personalized with an icon and a color.

This helps you visually organize and quickly identify different types of activities.

### How do notifications work?
Align lets you customize when you want to be notified about your time blocks. You can:
- Get notified right when a time block starts.
- Set reminders ahead of time (like 5, 15, 30 minutes before or even weeks!)
- Choose different notification settings for each time block.

### How do notification permissions work?
Align starts with iOS's "provisional" notification permission, which lets you receive quiet notifications on your lock screen without sounds or interruptions for a short period. This allows you to test out Align's notifications in a non-intrusive way.

You can easily grant permission through the time block editor when ready for full notifications with sounds and alerts. This gives you complete control over how and when you want to be notified about your time blocks.

After the provisional permission expires, you will stop receiving notifications from Align. To continue receiving notifications from the app, you must explicitly grant authorization.

### What happens if time blocks overlap?
Align visually highlights overlapping time blocks, making spotting and resolving scheduling conflicts easy. You can easily drag and drop blocks to reorganize your schedule when conflicts occur.

## Privacy & Data

### How is my data protected?
Your privacy is important to us. All your data is:
- Stored locally on your device and in your personal iCloud account
- Never shared with third parties.
- Protected by Apple's security features
- Not used for advertising purposes

<!-- ### Can I export my data?
Yes, Align allows you to export your time blocks and settings in standard formats for backup purposes or for use on other applications. -->
