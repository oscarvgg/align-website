title: Icon Suggestion Feature
---

Align's Icon Suggestion feature automatically recommends relevant icons for your time blocks based on the activity title you enter.

## How It Works

When creating a new time block, the system analyzes the title you type and suggests an appropriate icon that matches your activity.

### Process

The Icon Suggestion feature works as follows:

1. **Enter Title**: Type the title of your time block (e.g., "Morning Workout" or "Team Meeting")
2. **Processing**: After a brief pause, the system processes your text to identify the activity type
3. **Icon Suggestion**: A relevant icon is automatically suggested based on the activity

## Key Features

### Automatic Suggestions
- Icons appear automatically as you type your time block title
- No need to browse through hundreds of icons manually
- Suggestions appear after a brief pause to ensure accuracy

### Smart Recognition
The feature recognizes many types of activities, including:
- **Work tasks**: "Client call", "Project review", "Email time"
- **Personal activities**: "Gym workout", "Grocery shopping", "Reading"
- **Health & wellness**: "Meditation", "Doctor appointment", "Yoga class"
- **Social events**: "Dinner with friends", "Family time", "Date night"

### Manual Control
You can override automatic suggestions:
- Select any icon from the full icon library
- Manual icon selection disables automatic suggestions for that time block
- Full control over your schedule's visual appearance

## Tips for Better Suggestions

To get the most accurate icon suggestions:
- **Be specific**: Instead of "Meeting", try "Sales meeting" or "Team standup"
- **Use descriptive words**: "Morning jog" works better than just "Exercise"
- **Include context**: "Lunch with mom" gives better results than just "Lunch"

## When Suggestions Appear

Icon suggestions work best when:
- You're creating a new time block
- You type at least a few words describing your activity
- You pause briefly after typing (this prevents suggestions while you're still thinking)

## Privacy & Performance

Your time block titles stay private and are only used to generate icon suggestions. The feature is designed to be fast and efficient, so you won't experience any delays in your planning workflow.

## Getting Started
