Welcome to Align

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ We're passionate about helping you take control of your time and boost your productivity. As someone who has struggled with time management (haven't we all?), I know firsthand how overwhelming it can feel when tasks pile up and days seem to slip away.

That's why we created Align â€“ a powerful yet simple time management app that brings clarity to your daily schedule through visual time blocking.

## What is Time Blocking?

Time blocking is a game-changing productivity technique used by successful people like Elon Musk and Cal Newport. Instead of working from an endless to-do list, you assign specific time blocks to your tasks, creating a visual schedule of your day.

## Meet Align

Align takes time blocking to the next level by making it intuitive and flexible:

- **Visual Timeline**: See your entire day at a glance with a beautiful, color-coded timeline
<!-- - **Smart Scheduling**: Drag and drop time blocks to instantly reorganize your day -->
- **Calendar Integration**: Import your existing calendars to have all your commitments in one place
- **Recurring Tasks**: Build better habits by scheduling recurring time blocks
- **Gentle Reminders**: Stay on track with timely notifications
<!-- - **Cross-Platform**: Available soon for iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and macOS -->
