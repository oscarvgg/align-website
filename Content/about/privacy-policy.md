title: Privacy Policy of Align
---

Align is committed to respecting your privacy. Here's an overview of how we handle data:

### 1. Local and iCloud Data

All data you enter into the app is stored locally on your device and securely synced to your private iCloud account if iCloud sync is enabled. This ensures that your data remains under your control and is inaccessible to us.

### 2. Anonymous Analytics

To improve Align, we use **PostHog** for anonymous analytics. No personal data is collected. The analytics data helps us understand app usage trends and improve your experience.

### 3. Crash Reporting

To help us identify and fix issues that may affect your experience, we use **Firebase Crashlytics** for crash reporting. Crashlytics collects anonymous crash reports and diagnostic information when the app encounters an error. This data helps us improve app stability and performance. No personal information is collected through crash reports.

### 4. Feature Requests

We use WishKit, a third-party service for user feedback and feature requests. If you submit a request, only the information you voluntarily provide (e.g., feedback text, or feature suggestions) will be sent to WishKit's servers.

### 5. Third-party Services

To ensure transparency, here are the third-party services we use:

### 6. No Personal Data Collection

Align does not collect, share, or sell personal data. Your iCloud data remains private and accessible only to you via Apple's security measures.

### 7. In-App Purchases

Align offers optional in-app purchases through Align Plus subscriptions. All payment processing is handled securely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information. Subscription status is stored locally on your device and is not shared with third parties.

Users who used Align prior to version 1.12.0 are granted lifetime access to Align Plus features at no additional cost.
