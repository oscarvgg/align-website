Align is committed to respecting your privacy. Here's an overview of how we handle data:

### 1. Local and iCloud Data

All data you enter into the app is stored locally on your device and securely synced to your private iCloud account if iCloud sync is enabled. This ensures that your data remains under your control and is inaccessible to us.

### 2. Anonymous Analytics

To improve [Your App Name], we use **PostHog** for anonymous analytics. No personal data is collected. The analytics data helps us understand app usage trends and improve your experience.

### 3. Feature Requests

We use WishKit, a third-party service for user feedback and feature requests. If you submit a request, only the information you voluntarily provide (e.g., feedback text, or feature suggestions) will be sent to WishKit's servers.

### 4. Third-party Services

To ensure transparency, here are the third-party services we use:

- **PostHog**: Anonymous app usage analytics. [PostHog's privacy policy](https://posthog.com/privacy)
