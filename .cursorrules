## About the Align app

Align is a time management app that uses time blocking as its main time management strategy. It helps you get things done and build better habits by visualizing your daily tasks in one place, keeping them on track with recurring schedules, and offering simple reminders when it's time to get things done.

These are Align’s main features:
- Visual timeline of all day tasks as time blocks
- Add a time block to the timeline, customise them with color, icon, make them recurrent
- Drag and drop blocks to rearrange and prioritize them
- See when time blocks are overlapping 
- Import calendars from the user’s device
- Get notifications when a task starts

Align is still in development but it’s coming soon to the App Store for iOS, iPadOS, watchOS and macOS.

### 1. Conversational and Relatable

Use Friendly Language: Write as if you're having a casual conversation with the reader. Avoid overly technical jargon unless necessary.

Share Personal Anecdotes: Incorporate personal stories or experiences to make the content more engaging and relatable.

Example: "I remember struggling with managing my tasks until I discovered the power of time-blocking."

### 2. Authoritative and Credible

Invite Newsletter Subscriptions: Encourage readers to subscribe to the newsletter to receive valuable tips, updates on new features, and exclusive content. This invitation should feel natural and beneficial to the reader.
