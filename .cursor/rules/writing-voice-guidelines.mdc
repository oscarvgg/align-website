# Align Website Writing Voice Guidelines

This document outlines the writing voice and style guidelines for different types of content on the Align website.

## Blog Articles

For blog content, follow these guidelines inspired by Ali Abdaal's conversational yet authoritative approach:

### 1. Conversational and Relatable

- Use Friendly Language: Write as if you're having a casual conversation with the reader. Avoid overly technical jargon unless necessary.
- Example: Instead of saying "Implementing time-blocking techniques can optimize your daily schedule," say "Using time blocks can help you organize your day more effectively."
- Share Personal Anecdotes: Incorporate personal stories or experiences to make the content more engaging and relatable.
- Example: "I remember struggling with managing my tasks until I discovered the power of time-blocking."

### 2. Authoritative and Credible

- Reference Trusted Sources: Cite reputable books, studies, or experts to back up your points.
- Example: "According to productivity expert Jake Knapp, time-blocking can significantly enhance your efficiency."
- Demonstrate Expertise: Showcase your knowledge by providing in-depth insights and well-researched information.

### 3. Motivational and Encouraging

- Empower the Reader: Use uplifting language that motivates readers to take action.
- Example: "You have the power to take control of your time and boost your productivity."
- Positive Reinforcement: Encourage readers by acknowledging their efforts and potential for improvement.

### 4. Practical and Action-Oriented

- Provide Actionable Advice: Ensure each tip or suggestion is clear and can be implemented easily.
- Example: "Start by dedicating 30 minutes each morning to plan your day. List out your top three priorities and allocate specific time blocks for each."
- Use Real-Life Examples: Illustrate points with scenarios or case studies that readers can relate to.

### 5. Reflective and Personal

- Share Personal Insights: Offer your own reflections or lessons learned to add authenticity.
- Example: "I've found that allocating specific time blocks not only increases my productivity but also reduces my stress levels."
- Encourage Self-Reflection: Prompt readers to think about their own habits and how they can apply the tips provided.

### 6. Structured and Clear

- Organize Content Logically: Use clear headings and subheadings to break down the content into digestible sections.
- Example: Separate each time management tip with its own heading for easy navigation.
- Be Concise: Keep explanations straightforward and avoid unnecessary fluff. Ensure each section delivers value without overwhelming the reader.

### 7. Engaging and Interactive

- Ask Rhetorical Questions: Engage readers by prompting them to think about their own experiences.
- Example: "Have you ever felt overwhelmed by your daily tasks and wished for a better way to manage your time?"
- Encourage Interaction: Invite readers to share their thoughts or experiences in the comments section.

### 8. Subtle Promotion of Align App and Newsletter

- Promote Align's Features Gently: Integrate mentions of Align's app features seamlessly within the content. Highlight how specific features can enhance the reader's productivity without being overly sales-driven.
- Example: "Using time blocks can help you organize your day more effectively. Align's visual timeline feature makes it easy to see all your tasks at a glance."
- Invite Newsletter Subscriptions: Encourage readers to subscribe to the newsletter to receive valuable tips, updates on new features, and exclusive content. This invitation should feel natural and beneficial to the reader.
- Example: "For more productivity tips and updates on new features, make sure to subscribe to our newsletter."

### Blog Article Structure

- Start with a relatable problem
- Provide actionable solutions
- Include real-life examples
- Naturally integrate Align's features
- End with a clear call-to-action

## Help Pages

Help pages serve a different purpose than blog articles and require a more formal, documentation-style approach:

### 1. Direct and Informational

- Get Straight to the Point: Start with a clear, concise explanation of what the feature or process does
- Example: "Align's Icon Suggestion feature automatically recommends relevant icons for your time blocks based on the activity title you enter."
- Avoid Questions: Don't start with rhetorical questions or casual conversation starters
- Avoid: "Have you ever struggled to find the perfect icon?"
- Prefer: "The Icon Suggestion feature helps you quickly select appropriate icons for your activities."

### 2. Professional and Authoritative

- Use Professional Language: Maintain a serious, documentation-style tone
- Avoid Casual Expressions: Remove phrases like "No problem!", "like magic", or overly enthusiastic language
- Example: Instead of "Don't like the suggestion? No problem!" use "You can override automatic suggestions"
- Be Factual: Present information objectively without emotional language

### 3. Clear and Structured

- Use Descriptive Headings: Choose straightforward section titles
- Avoid: "The Magic Behind the Scenes"
- Prefer: "How It Works" or "Process"
- Organize Logically: Structure information in a logical flow from overview to specific details
- Use Numbered Lists: For processes and step-by-step instructions

### 4. Concise and Practical

- Eliminate Fluff: Every sentence should provide useful information
- Use Bullet Points: Break down complex information into digestible points
- Be Specific: Provide concrete examples and clear instructions
- Example: "Type the title of your time block (e.g., 'Morning Workout' or 'Team Meeting')"

### 5. Technical Accuracy

- Use Precise Language: Be specific about how features work
- Avoid Anthropomorphism: Don't give human qualities to the software
- Avoid: "Align thinks about your input"
- Prefer: "The system processes your text"
- Maintain Consistency: Use the same terminology throughout

### 6. Minimal Promotional Content

- Focus on Functionality: Prioritize explaining how features work over selling benefits
- Link to Related Pages: Reference other help articles or quick start guides when relevant
- Keep CTAs Simple: End with brief references to related documentation rather than promotional content

### Help Page Structure

- Clear title that matches the feature name
- Brief introductory sentence explaining the feature's purpose
- "How It Works" section with step-by-step process
- Key features and functionality details
- Usage tips and best practices
- Related links to other help content

## Implementation Guidelines

- Voice Consistency: Regularly review content to ensure the tone remains consistent with these guidelines
- Content Type Awareness: Always consider whether you're writing a blog article or help documentation
