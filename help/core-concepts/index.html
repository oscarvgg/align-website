Whether you're new to time blocking or just new to Align, this guide explains the fundamental ideas that make the app work.</p><h2>What Is Time Blocking?</h2><p>Time blocking is a time management method where you divide your day into blocks of time, with each block dedicated to accomplishing a specific task or group of tasks.</p><p>Instead of keeping an open-ended to-do list and working on whatever feels urgent, you decide in advance what you'll work on and when. You're essentially making appointments with yourself to get things done.</p><p><strong>Why it works</strong>: Time blocking transforms your intentions into concrete plans. When you allocate specific time to a task, you're much more likely to actually do it. You also get a realistic picture of what you can accomplish in a day, helping you avoid overcommitting.</p><p><strong>How Align helps</strong>: Align visualizes your time blocks on a timeline, making it easy to see your entire day at a glance, identify conflicts, and adjust your schedule as your day unfolds.</p><h2>Time Blocks: The Building Blocks of Your Day</h2><p>In Align, everything revolves around <strong>time blocks</strong>—visual representations of tasks and activities on your timeline.</p><h3>What Makes a Time Block</h3><p>Each time block has:</p><ul><li><strong>A title</strong> describing what you'll do (like "Morning Workout" or "Client Presentation")</li><li><strong>A start time and end time</strong> defining when the activity happens</li><li><strong>Visual customization</strong> with colors and icons to make your schedule easy to scan</li><li><strong>Optional recurrence</strong> for tasks that repeat daily, weekly, or on a custom schedule</li></ul><h3>Types of Time Blocks</h3><p><strong>Tasks you create</strong>: These are activities you add directly in Align—your workouts, focus time, errands, meals, or any commitment you want to schedule.</p><p><strong>Calendar events</strong>: Align can sync with your device's calendars, showing your meetings, appointments, and events alongside your planned tasks. This gives you one complete view of your day.</p><p><strong>Recurring blocks</strong>: Whether it's a daily meditation, weekly team meeting, or monthly review, you can set time blocks to repeat automatically, building consistent routines into your schedule.</p><h2>The Timeline: Your Visual Schedule</h2><p>The timeline is your home screen in Align—a vertical view of your entire day where all your time blocks live.</p><h3>How It Works</h3><p><strong>Time runs top to bottom</strong>: Morning activities appear at the top, evening activities at the bottom. Scroll to see your whole day from wake-up to bedtime.</p><p><strong>Visual hierarchy</strong>: Different colors and icons help you quickly distinguish between work tasks, personal time, health activities, and social commitments.</p><p><strong>Real-time view</strong>: Your timeline shows exactly what's happening now, what's coming up next, and what you've already completed.</p><h3>Why It Matters</h3><p>The timeline transforms abstract plans into something concrete and visual. Instead of wondering "When will I have time to exercise today?", you can see exactly where that 45-minute workout fits between your morning meeting and lunch.</p><p>This visual representation helps you:</p><ul><li><strong>See your whole day</strong> at once without flipping between lists and calendars</li><li><strong>Identify conflicts</strong> when two things are scheduled for the same time</li><li><strong>Find gaps</strong> where you have unscheduled time for breaks or unexpected tasks</li><li><strong>Stay realistic</strong> about what you can actually accomplish in a day</li></ul><h2>Calendar Integration</h2><p>Align doesn't replace your existing calendars—it works with them to give you a complete picture of your time.</p><h3>How It Works</h3><p><strong>Sync your calendars</strong>: Connect Align to the calendars on your device (iCloud, Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.)</p><p><strong>Unified view</strong>: All your calendar events appear as time blocks on your timeline, right alongside the tasks you create in Align.</p><p><strong>Two-way sync</strong>: Changes you make in Align can sync back to your calendars (for calendars that allow editing), and updates in your calendar apps appear in Align.</p><h3>Calendar Permissions</h3><p><strong>Editable calendars</strong>: For calendars where you have edit permissions, you can create, modify, move, and delete time blocks directly in Align.</p><p><strong>Read-only calendars</strong>: Some calendars (like shared work calendars or subscribed calendars) don't allow modifications. Events from these calendars appear in Align but are automatically <a href="/help/locking-time-blocks">locked</a> to prevent accidental changes.</p><h2>Duration and Flexibility</h2><p>Time blocks in Align are flexible—they adapt as your day unfolds.</p><h3>Adjusting Your Schedule</h3><p><strong><a href="/help/resizing-time-blocks">Resizing</a></strong>: Drag the edges of a time block to make it longer or shorter when plans change.</p><p><strong>Drag and drop</strong>: Move time blocks to different times by dragging them to a new position on the timeline.</p><p><strong><a href="/help/locking-time-blocks">Locking</a></strong>: Protect important appointments from accidental changes by locking them in place.</p><p><strong><a href="/help/overlap-avoidance">Overlap avoidance</a></strong>: Let Align automatically reorganize your schedule when you make changes, or disable it when you need more manual control.</p><h3>Planning vs. Reality</h3><p>Your timeline isn't meant to be rigid. It's a living plan that adapts to reality:</p><p><strong>Morning planning</strong>: Start your day by reviewing and adjusting your time blocks to reflect your priorities and energy levels.</p><p><strong>Mid-day adjustments</strong>: When a task takes longer than expected or something urgent comes up, resize and rearrange your blocks to accommodate the change.</p><p><strong>Evening reflection</strong>: At the end of the day, adjust your time blocks to reflect what actually happened. This helps you learn how long tasks really take and plan more accurately in the future.</p><h2>Recurring Time Blocks: Building Habits</h2><p>Recurring time blocks are the foundation of building consistent habits and routines.</p><h3>Why Recurring Blocks Matter</h3><p>Some activities benefit from happening at the same time regularly:</p><ul><li><strong>Morning routines</strong> like meditation, exercise, or journaling</li><li><strong>Work blocks</strong> like focused coding sessions or email processing</li><li><strong>Health habits</strong> like meals at consistent times or evening wind-down routines</li><li><strong>Regular commitments</strong> like team meetings, classes, or social activities</li></ul><p>By making these blocks recur automatically, you don't have to recreate them every day. They become the stable framework around which you plan the rest of your schedule.</p><h3>Types of Recurrence</h3><p><strong>Daily</strong>: Activities that happen every day or every weekday (like morning workout or daily standup)</p><p><strong>Weekly</strong>: Tasks that repeat on specific days each week (like yoga on Tuesday and Thursday)</p><p><strong>Custom</strong>: More complex patterns for activities that repeat less frequently</p><h2>Notifications: Staying on Track</h2><p>Align helps you stick to your schedule with timely notifications.</p><p><strong>Task reminders</strong>: Get notified when it's time to start a time block, so you can transition smoothly from one activity to the next.</p><p><strong>Customizable timing</strong>: Set notifications to appear right when a task starts, or a few minutes before to give yourself transition time.</p><p><strong>Smart defaults</strong>: Align learns from your notification preferences to suggest appropriate settings for new time blocks.</p><p>Notifications transform your visual timeline into an active system that keeps you on track throughout the day.</p><h2>Visual Organization</h2><p>Align gives you powerful tools to make your schedule easy to understand at a glance.</p><h3>Colors</h3><p>Different colors help you categorize time blocks:</p><ul><li><strong>Work</strong> might be blue</li><li><strong>Personal</strong> might be green</li><li><strong>Health &amp; fitness</strong> might be orange</li><li><strong>Social</strong> might be purple</li></ul><p>Choose colors that make sense to you—there's no right or wrong system. The goal is to make your timeline scannable so you can quickly assess your day's balance.</p><h3>Icons</h3><p><a href="/help/icon-suggestion">Icons</a> add another layer of visual information. A running icon for your morning jog, a coffee cup for your afternoon break, or a laptop for focused work time.</p><p><strong>Icon suggestions</strong>: Align can automatically suggest relevant icons based on your time block titles, making it faster to build a visually rich timeline.</p><h2>Getting Started with These Concepts</h2><p>Now that you understand the core concepts, you're ready to dive into Align:</p><ol><li><strong>Start with today</strong>: Create a few time blocks for your main activities today</li><li><strong>Add some color</strong>: Customize your blocks with colors and icons that make sense to you</li><li><strong>Set up recurring blocks</strong>: Add your regular commitments so they appear automatically</li><li><strong>Connect your calendars</strong>: Sync your existing calendars to see everything in one place</li><li><strong>Practice flexibility</strong>: Adjust your time blocks as the day unfolds—your timeline should serve you, not constrain you</li></ol><p>The beauty of Align is that you can start simple and gradually incorporate more features as you become comfortable with the basics.</p><h2>Need More Help?</h2><p>Ready to put these concepts into practice?
