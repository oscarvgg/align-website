I've made a bunch of templates to get you started with time blocking quickly and easily. If you want to learn more about time blocking <a href="/blog/time-blocking-a-productivity-game-changer/">here</a> is a full article about it.</p><p>A time blocking template is a pre-made structure for your day, week, or month. To use a time blocking template, you need to set aside blocks of time for the different tasks that need to get done. Then the day, week, or month is divided into those blocks, and each block has a specific task or goal associated with it.</p><h2>Get the templates now</h2><p>You can download and print these templates or edit them on your computer and keep a digital copy. I recommend keeping them on your phone, so you can quickly access them anytime.</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SU82fw8Viqa4RkNZkmHdqiXzknWDbUMEeCjEjLFJKBs/copy">Time Blocking Template on Google Sheets</a></li><li><a href="/templates/time-blocking-template-printable-daily-weekly-monthly-by-align-v1.xlsx">Time Blocking Template on Excel</a></li><li><a href="/templates/time-blocking-template-printable-daily-by-align-v1.pdf">Time Blocking Template on pdf (daily)</a></li><li><a href="/templates/time-blocking-template-printable-weekly-5-days-by-align-v1.pdf">Time Blocking Template on pdf (weekly 5 days)</a></li><li><a href="/templates/time-blocking-template-printable-weekly-7-days-by-align-v1.pdf">Time Blocking Template on pdf (weekly 7 days)</a></li><li><a href="/templates/time-blocking-template-printable-monthly-by-align-v1.pdf">Time Blocking Template on pdf (monthly/calendar)</a></li></ul><h2>How to do a time blocking schedule with a template</h2><p>Your first block is for your most productive tasks. This could be studying, writing, or doing research. It could also be making phone calls or working on a spreadsheet. The point is that this is when you want to get stuff done and avoid being interrupted by anything else.</p><p>Your second block of time should be reserved for things that take a lot of effort or energy, like exercising or cleaning your home. Don't think, "I'm not stressed enough" or "I'll do it later." You will feel much better once these tasks are crossed off your list!</p><p>Your third block should include things that require less brainpower: watching Netflix/YouTube/TV; taking walks outside; going shopping for groceries, etc.</p><h3>Block off time for your most productive tasks</h3><p>Now that you've blocked off time for your most productive tasks, it's time to block off time for things that take a lot of effort or energy. For example:</p><ul><li>If exercise is part of your morning routine and helps you get into a good mood, block off an hour before work in which to do it.</li><li>If cleaning the house needs doing but can be put off until later in the day (or week), block off an hour or two where you're sure not to be disturbed by anyone else so they don't distract you from getting things done quickly and efficiently.</li></ul><p>The same goes for other tasks like studying, planning projects ahead of time, calling friends/family members who live far away...anything where there's no urgency but still wants to be done!</p><h3>Block off time for things that take a lot of effort or energy, like exercising or cleaning your home.</h3><p>If you're not already a regular exerciser, it can be tempting to put off exercise until later in the day or week. But if you block off time for physical activity, it's much more likely that you'll actually do it and reap all of its benefits.</p><p>For example, if exercising is vital to your health and well-being but feels like an afterthought rather than an essential part of your day, try setting aside 30 minutes every morning before work or school so that it becomes part of your routine. This way, when 5 p.m. rolls around on Monday night and everyone else wants nothing more than their couch and Netflix account (or maybe even just getting home), there won't be any excuses left!</p><h3>Block off time for things you enjoy and those that don't require too much brainpower.</h3><p>The next step is to block off time for things you enjoy. This could be something like going to a movie with friends or taking your dog for a walk around the park. These are things that require little brainpower but still make you feel good.</p><p>The final step is to block off time for things that don't require too much brainpower. These include checking email or making phone calls, which may not be very exciting but are still essential tasks in your life!</p><h3>Repeat this process until all days are blocked off in your week.</h3><p>You can repeat this process for a month or more, adjusting your schedule as needed. This template is intended as a guide to help you create your own time blocking template.</p><h2>Tips and tricks</h2><p>Here are some tips and tricks to make the most out of your time blocking template:</p><h3>List your TO-DO's at the top</h3><p>When you know you have to do something but don't know when you'll have time to do it, just put it at the top, outside of yourt schedule, and then put it in when you have finished placing your more important tasks. You could work on that if you finish a task earlier than expected or if something else cleared off before it started.</p><h3>Use Colors</h3><p>You can use colors to highlight your tasks and write them with colorful markers. Using colors, you categorize time blocks, differentiate between kinds of tasks and even set priorities. It's a great way to make your schedule more visually appealing and easy to understand at first sight.</p><h3>Block distractions</h3><p>When you start a task, focus completely on it. Do not let yourself be distracted by social media, email, news sites, or games — anything else unimportant to your schedule. On your phone, set a "focus mode" so messages from notifications won't distract you.</p><h2>Types of time blocking templates</h2><p>So far in this article, I've been talking mostly about the weekly time blocking template. Still, there are several others that you may be a better fit for what you need:</p><h3>Daily Time Blocking Template</h3><p>The main advantage of using this template is that it allows me to plan my day and divide it into specific tasks. It makes me more productive by helping me prioritize my work and manage my time more efficiently.</p><p>I usually spend a few minutes the day before, planning the tasks that I have to accomplish. It has helped me be more productive, achieve faster and produce better results.</p><p>Then start my day with this template and adjust it accordingly depending on how much time I have left before going to bed.</p><h3>Weekly Time Blocking Template</h3><p>The weekly time blocking template is a great way to get started with goal setting and short-term planning. The template helps you visualize your week, prioritize activities and tasks, then plan the best course of action for accomplishing each.</p><h3>Monthly time blocking template</h3><p>A monthly time blocking template is an excellent tool for helping you stay organized and plan your schedule for the month ahead. It will allow you to see how much time you have available for specific tasks, and then help you prioritize what needs to get done first.</p><p>While most people have some idea of what they're doing on a daily basis, it can be challenging to plan ahead further than that. A monthly time blocking template can help you keep track of your long-term goals so that they don't get lost in the shuffle.</p><p>If you want to start writing a book but don't know exactly how much time it will take, or if you want to start exercising more but aren't sure how much time you can make for that activity each week or month, then this type of template will help keep your goals front and center.</p><h2>Use an App</h2><p>Templates are good to get started with time blocking but prioritizing, rearranging tasks, and setting alerts manually is hard. Using an app can make things easier; you can track our progress and based on what's important, rearrange or remove tasks and get notifications when is time to start a new task. <a href="/blog/time-blocking-apps-a-comprehensive-guide-to-maximizing-productivity/">Here</a> is an article with the best apps for time blocking.</p><p>That's why I'm building Align, a powerful tool for staying focused and getting things done. It allows you to customize, prioritize, and visualize time blocks at a glance, see double booking or conflicting tasks, sync with calendars across devices, and get timely notifications.</p><p>Align is still in development, but you can <a href="#waiting-list">join the waiting list now</a> and get notified when it's available for download.</p><h2>Who can benefit from a time blocking template</h2><h3>Busy professionals</h3><p>If you are a busy professional, working with a time blocking template can help you manage your tasks effectively. You will be able to keep track of all the work you have to do during the day, which will help you finish everything on time.</p><h3>Students</h3><p>Students often struggle because they need to know how much time they need to spend on each subject. With a time blocking template, students can manage their study hours more efficiently to stay caught up and save time studying the necessary topics.</p><h3>Remote workers</h3><p>Remote workers often need help managing their time at home because they need an office environment where everyone works together. A remote work environment requires special attention when scheduling meetings and other significant events for everyone to stay connected without missing anything important. With a remote work template, it is easy for remote workers to schedule meetings.</p><h3>Parents</h3><p>Parents are busy with work and family life, but once again, there are ways for them to find more free time for themselves within their busy schedules. With a time blocking template, parents can make sure they're spending enough time with their children while also ensuring they're taking care of themselves!</p><h3>People with ADHD</h3><p>If you have ADHD, you may find it difficult to focus on one thing at a time. A time blocking template can help you create a schedule that allows you to focus on each activity until it's completed without constantly switching back and forth between different things.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>If you want to make the most of your free time, you must block out time for the things that matter most. You can ensure everything gets done efficiently by scheduling your tasks and duties in advance. This will also help reduce stress by keeping track of everything in your life at once.</p><p>There are many different types of time-blocking templates out there, but they all have the same goal: to help you get things done. While it may take a lot of effort to sit down and create a schedule for yourself, it will be well worth the time spent once you start seeing results.</p></div></article></div><section id="waiting-list" class="mt-16"><div class="hero md:p-16"><div class="hero-content flex-col lg:flex-row space-x-4"><div><h2>Coming soon</h2><p class="py-6">Align is a powerful tool for staying focused and getting things done.
